Color is my specialty and I am passionate about making works of art with hair that you get to wear every day.
One of the most important things I pay careful attention to is your hair house you can have gorgeous hair you can have gorgeous color and healthy hair.
I will work with you to make sure you understand the effects of different treatments will have on your hair and to choose the right care to protect your color and the health of your hair.
Prices for color vary depending on several factors things that can affect how much work time and product product go into your style.

It may take me more time, care, and product if your hair:
* been colored or chemically treated (relaxers, perms, bleach) in the past year
* is very damaged due to any chemical processes
* is very dark, very thick, or very long

Please also keep in mind that even if your hair has never been touched by any chemical processes or color, the first color may take more time as well - especially if you want to go lighter or brighter.

Assuming no previous treatments are other color and or chemical processes for hair that is about shoulder length of a medium brown; a single color process is usually $65. If you aren't sure what you need contact me by text to set up a consultation.

One final note: extreme current color corrections or changes that take more than five hours to do are subject to a $60 hourly rate.

I've been cutting and styling hair since 2006.

Not every head needs a $40 haircut. It's important to me to customize your cut to fit you perfectly so the price should put your cut is well!
The most basic buzz cut starts at $10 and go up to $40.  Prices depend on how elaborate your cut is. For example, long hair and hair with elaborate layers takes more time, care, and attention to detail so these cuts will cost more.
